### Project 1: Public Transportation & Income in the San Francisco Bay Area

This project examines the relationship between access to public transit and median household income levels in the Bay Area, California. I really liked how the creator chose to include 2 graphs in his "Graphic Data" section: one with the non-adjusted data and one with the adjusted data. As he described in the explainer below the graph, the non-adjusted data hinders our ability to see the correlation between transit access and income, because there is a confounding variable â€” population. Areas in the Bay Area that have a higher population (such as San Francisco and other large cities) will naturally have a greater density of transit stops, regardless of residents' income levels. By dividing all raw stop counts by their municipal populations the linear relationship between access to public transit and income levels becomes more evident. The grouping (by color) of stops within each metro area on the graph is also useful, as each area can be represented by a different correlation slope. I would have appreciated some analysis of other factors that play into the relationship as well. For example, one question I am left with is: what are the socioeconomic differences between each of the metro areas analyzed (Alameda, Contra Costa, Napa, San Franscisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma)? Perhaps another graph could have showcased the average household income levels within each area to allow for comparison. Furthermore, I thought the interactive visualization map was very cool, but difficult to read. Some labels to describe what each of the numbers mean and what the names of each of the municipalities are would be helpful.
